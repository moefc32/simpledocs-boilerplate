The top level is an array where each object represents a category, acting as a container for related pages. The \u003Ccode>name\u003C/code> property defines the category title, which helps in grouping documentation topics logically.","Each category contains a \u003Ccode>pages\u003C/code> array that holds individual documentation pages. Every page has a \u003Ccode>title\u003C/code> for display, a \u003Ccode>slug\u003C/code> for unique identification in URLs, and a \u003Ccode>contents\u003C/code> array that stores all structured information for that page. The \u003Ccode>contents\u003C/code> array will later hold sections, paragraphs, or other content elements that make up the documentation.
